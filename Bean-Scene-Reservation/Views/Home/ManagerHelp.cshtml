<h2>Managing Tables & Areas</h2>

<p>
    You can manage all of the tables and the areas within Bean Scene from the manager portal.
</p>
<p>
    In the 'Manage Areas' page, you can view all of the areas within the restaurant in a list, 
    displaying their Names and the Tables associated with them.
</p>
<p>
    You can create an area by clicking the '<i class="bi-plus-circle"></i>Add Area' button, 
    and typing in its name, and clicking 'Save'.
</p>
<p>
    You can edit the name of an area by clicking on the grey '<i class="bi bi-pencil"></i>Edit' button,
    and you can delete an area by clicking the red '<i class="bi bi-trash"></i>Delete' button.
</p>
<p>
    If an area has tables assoicated with it, you cannot delete it, 
    replacing the delete button with a '<i class="bi bi-ban"></i>' button.
